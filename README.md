a dumb orbit propagator

I wrote this code when I was bored and as a demo for my kids.
Also I wanted to test the formulas we see on live webcasts that gives a realtime
value of body perigee while a rocket is going to orbit:
it is very cool to see the perigee become positive as soon as the rocket is
orbital, all of this computed from the real time state vectors of the rocket
with no other knowledge of orbital elements.

it can just simulate orbiting bodies in 2D.
See pics in step 1 when varying the speed of the ISS at the same altitude.
Results are reasonable given actual values from wikipedia!
This gives me confidence so I may upgrade this to a complete simulation
program at one point, including user interface, 3d orbits, thrusters,
rocket bodies and attitude, atmospheric drag...

No, I dont know if and when I will do that. No I am not rewriting KSP.
I have so many projects and so little time. I may forget this.
Please write issues with ideas, reminders, or useful code.
