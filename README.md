a dumb orbit propagator

I wrote this code when I was bored and as a demo for my kids.

it can just simulate orbiting bodies in 2D. See pics in step 1 when varying the speed of the ISS at the same altitude.
Results are reasonable given actual values, this gives me confidence so I may upgrade this to a complete simulation program at one point.
